::

    Demonstrate the use of Composition of Atom objects.
    
    1. If the class has not been declared, use a ForwardTyped
       - Note the use of lambda, because "Person" is not yet defined
    
    2. A Typed object can be instantiated three ways:
       - Provide args, kwargs, or a factory in the definition
       - Provide a _default_* static constructor
       - Provide a pre-created object in the constructor

::

 $ python composition.py

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/api/composition.py
    :language: python


Output:

.. code-block:: python
